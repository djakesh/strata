      "title": "Magnetometry",
      "description": "Magnetometry is used to measure variations in the Earth's magnetic field, which can be influenced by ferromagnetic minerals in the subsurface. It includes both ground-based and UAV-based (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) surveys, the latter providing a broader area coverage and access to challenging terrains."
